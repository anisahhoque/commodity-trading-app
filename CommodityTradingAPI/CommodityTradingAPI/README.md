Everything in this folder is related to the API program.

## Files

 - Controllers/ - Contains all files related to the logic of the program. Controllers are named by the model they handle, for example `ChatController.cs` contains all logic that handles RocketChat within the API.
 - Data - Contains the DbContext logic, this is what links the database to the API code.
 - Models - All the classes used to run the logic. Many of these were autogenerated through the DbContext integration so follow a standard format.
 - Services - All code relating to services throughout the logic, these typically handle a complex task that is needed throughout the code. In our case this is where all the logging logic is including relevant interfaces and classes.
 - CommodityTradingAPI/csproj, CommodityTradingAPI.http and .editorconfig - These are all files auto created by visual studio and are unlikely to ever need being changed.
 - Program.cs - The core startup program, edit this when you need to register a new service or alter something fundamental about the logic that pulls everything together.
